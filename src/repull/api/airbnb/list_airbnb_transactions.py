     List Airbnb host transactions (reservation earnings, payouts, resolution adjustments) for this

    breakdown (accommodation subtotal, cleaning fee, host + guest service fees split base/VAT, tax
    buckets, expected/actual host payout with settlement status). Trigger a refresh with `POST` on this

    Transactions of reservations on inactive listings are left out; payout rows, which belong to no
    listing, are always included.

    **Several Airbnb accounts?** A workspace can connect more than one. By default this returns every
    connected account's rows; pass `?account_id=<airbnb host id>` to scope to one. Every row carries
    `accountId` + `accountName` either way, and `dataFreshness.accounts[]` reports each account's
    freshness separately, so one disconnected host no longer marks the whole response stale.
