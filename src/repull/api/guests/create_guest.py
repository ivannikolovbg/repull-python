     Creates a guest in the workspace, with contact normalisation applied (phone digits, email

    **This is find-or-create, and the response tells you which happened.** A guest already on file
    matching on email — then phone — AND name is returned instead of a duplicate being created. Read the
    `created` flag rather than inferring from the status: `201` with `created: true` means a new record
    was written, `200` with `created: false` means an existing guest matched. Quietly handing back an
    existing record as though it were new is exactly the ambiguity this flag removes.

    dropped.
